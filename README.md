Hangman Game in C is a simple C program which has been designed to demonstrate different application formats and syntaxes of C programming language. In the game, there is not any use of graphics, user defined function and user defined header file. The most frequently used control statements in this Hangman Game are if() and if()..else sentences as well as iterative statements such as for() loop. The main purpose of the project is to illustrate use of control structures.
