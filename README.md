Project Title: HANGMAN IN C PROGRAM

Description: 
Hangman is a quick and easy game for at least two people that requires nothing more than paper, a pencil, and the ability to spell. One player, the "host," makes up a secret word, while the other player tries to guess the word by asking what letters it contains. However, every wrong guess brings them one step closer to losing. Hangman can also be customized to make the game easier, harder, or educational, and there are apps and websites to play online if you would like. For example, try adding in symbols such as # to make the game harder!


Feature:
The feature of Hangman in C is that you won't need a paper and pencil to play it because you can now play it in your computer!
